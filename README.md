# Text Summarization Project

## Overview

This project implements a text summarization system that generates concise and coherent summaries from longer texts. The system utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically transformer-based models, to achieve state-of-the-art performance in abstractive text summarization.

## Workflows

1. Update config.yaml
2. Update params.yaml
3. Update entity
4. Update the configuration manager in src config
5. update the conponents
6. update the pipeline
7. update the main.py
8. update the app.py

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Transformers Library
- Datasets Library
- GPU (for accelerated training)
- Additional dependencies (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Data Preparation:
Prepare your dataset for training and evaluation. Ensure it is in a format compatible with the Datasets library.

2. Training:
Train the summarization model using the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks. Customize hyperparameters and model architecture as needed.

3. Inference:
Use the trained model to generate summaries for input texts. Implement a CLI or API for convenient access.

4. Evaluation:
Evaluate the quality of generated summaries using metrics like ROUGE scores. Provide scripts for automated evaluation.

5. Deployment (Optional):
Deploy the model as a web service or integrate it into other applications for real-time summarization.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

data/: Directory for storing datasets and data preprocessing scripts.
models/: Contains the trained summarization models and model definition scripts.
src/: Source code for the text summarization system.
scripts/: Utility scripts for training, inference, and evaluation.
config/: Configuration files for model hyperparameters and system settings.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.
tests/: Unit tests and test data for validating the codebase.
